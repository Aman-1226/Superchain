            <p>
              “Blockchain” means a distributed digital ledger that is not under
              the control of a single identifiable or discreet individual or
              entity and where accounts (including units of account contained in
              them) cannot be manipulated without providing a user’s specific
              private key. This may be a “main net” used as a determinative
              record of historical events and transactions on the ledger, or a
              “test net” which operates like a main net but does not have a
              Cryptocurrency that carries substantial real-world value and is
              generally used for simulated or testing purposes.

            <p>2.2</p>
            <p>
              “Cryptocurrency”, “Cryptocurrencies” is a reference to the
              distributed, decentralized peer-to-peer digital currencies that
              are tracked by a Blockchain. For the purposes of this Terms of
              Use, “Cryptocurrency” includes, but is not limited to, the
              following distributed digital ledgers (both related mainnets and
              testnets): Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Fantom, Chainlink, Algorand,
              Ton, Celo, Regen, Oasis, Coda, Dfinity.

              direct our systems to function in a way that is not permitted (as
